      Welcome to my portfolio, my name is Martha Fields-Cypress. For three years, I was a high school math teacher and 
      gained a diverse set of skills ranging from problem-solving, empathy, collaboration, organization and leadership. 
      I then joined a development team as a frontend developer to be exposed the development process to better prepare 
      for a position of scrum master.

      Ever since I can remember I have been fascinated by the differences in how people think, wanting to find solutions
      to a myriad of problems. This has led me down a career path centered around people, first being a teacher and now
      working towards facilitating teams to be more effective and efficient. I am eager to join a team that
      understands and values the importance of collaboration and always strives to improve.
