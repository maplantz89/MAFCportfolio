      Welcome to my portfolio, my name is Martha Fields-Cypress. I am a career changer excited to continue down this new
      adventure. For three years, I was a high school math teacher and gained a diverse set of skills ranging from
      problem-solving, empathy, collaboration, organization and leadership skills. While still at the beginning of my career,
      I am continuing to develop my skill set in front-end development while gaining an interest in user 
      experience with an emphasis in research and information architecture.

      Ever since I can remember I have been fascinated by the differences in how people think, wanting to find solutions
      to a myriad of problems. This has led me down a career path centered around people, first being a teacher and now
      working to create products that people use every day more accessible and effective. I am eager to join a team that
      understands and values the importance of collaboration and always strives to improve.
